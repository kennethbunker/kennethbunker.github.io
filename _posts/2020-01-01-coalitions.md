This article is titled Why do parties cooperate in presidentialism? Electoral and government coalition formation in Latin America and was published in Revista de Estudios Políticos. The article contributes to the burgeoning body of literature preoccupied with building a theory of coalition formation particular to presidentialism. In particular, it contributes by finding that within each of the theories put forward, some variables are more important than others, such as the president’s informal authority in the formateur power theory, bicameralism, proportional representation and the size of the legislature in the electoral structure theory, and the number of parties in the party system theory.
