I wrote a review for *Journal of Latin American Studies* on Richard Nadeau, Éric Bélanger, Michael S. Lewis-Beck, Mathieu Turgeon and François Gélineau’s book: Latin American Elections: Choice and Change (University of Michigan Press). I found that it makes groundbreaking progress in identifying the applicability of the funnel of causality model in Latin America. Its major contribution is to propose an unprecedented single overarching scientifically unified model of regional voting. Indeed, despite some recent contributions, and a long list of individual country case studies, few efforts have been made in this direction. In many ways, it is the first of its kind. You can buy the book [here](https://www.amazon.com/Latin-American-Elections-Choice-Change/dp/0472130226) and read my review [here](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-latin-american-studies/article/richard-nadeau-eric-belanger-michael-s-lewisbeck-mathieu-turgeon-and-francois-gelineau-latin-american-elections-choice-and-change-ann-arbor-mi-university-of-michigan-press-2017-pp-248-7000-hb/78AF112A501B7C676B822AA6D545F2D2).
