I wrote a review for Democratization on Pippa Norris and Ron Inglehartâ€™s (2019) book: Cultural Backlash: Trump, Brexit, and Authoritarian Populism. I found that its contribution is not only in its account of the rise of authoritarian populism across the Western world, but also in its suggestion of a changing social and political landscape. It shows that the demise of the longstanding left-right cleavage has not been in vain. In its place, a new social and political cardinal map, anchored in a pluralist-populist and a liberal-authoritarian continuum, is rising. You can buy the book here and read my review here.
